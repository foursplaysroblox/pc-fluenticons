# Fluent Icons
An icon pack for Replugged, Powercord & BetterDiscord that replaces most icons with Microsoft's Modern Fluent Design Icons from Windows 11. This theme is forked/based on [GoogleMaterialIcons](https://github.com/DavidNyan10/GoogleMaterialIcons). Also I forked this pc-fluenticons theme the orginal is here: [Original](https://github.com/stickfab/pc-fluenticons)
